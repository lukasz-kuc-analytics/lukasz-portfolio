# Operational Analytics Prototype (Python + Power BI)

##  Description
Prototype analytics system for monitoring operational anomalies in logistics.  
It combines **Python, Power BI, and Lean Six Sigma** methods to detect exceptions, log them, and visualize KPIs.

---

##  Components
- **Dataset** (inventory + shipments)  
- **Python scripts** (decision engine for exception handling)  
- **Logbook** (traceability of alerts and actions)  
- **Power BI dashboard** (KPIs, Pareto analysis, costs)

##  Key Outcomes
- Identified critical bottlenecks (weight conflict, unbound inventory)  
- Quantified operational and financial impact (hours & â‚¬)  
- Focused improvement efforts using Pareto principle  
- Created scalable framework for exception handling in supply chains
