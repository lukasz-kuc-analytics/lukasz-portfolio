Portfolio showcasing projects in supply chain analytics, Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Six Sigma
# Operational Analytics Prototype (Python + Power BI)

 Duration: June 2025 – Present

##  Description
I developed a prototype analytics system to monitor and evaluate operational anomalies in logistics workflows.

The project combined:
-  **Python** – for data preparation, simulations, and automated calculations,  
-  **Power BI** – for creating interactive dashboards with KPI tracking (time, cost, frequency),  
-  **Lean Six Sigma** – for applying Pareto analysis and process efficiency metrics.  

##  Key Outcomes
✅ Identified critical bottlenecks,  
✅ Quantified operational and financial impact (hours & costs),  
✅ Focused improvement efforts on the “vital few” categories (Pareto principle).  

This project demonstrates my ability to combine **technical (Python, BI tools)** and **process improvement (Six Sigma)** skills to deliver actionable insights in a fast-paced supply chain environment.
